# The Complete End-to-End DevOps Project - Part 2

This project is a continuation of the previous repository, **[microservice_mern_stack_eks_infrastructure](https://github.com/RyderGreystorm/microservice_mern_stack_eks_infrastructure)**. In the first part, we fully automated the deployment of a production-grade EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster. 

## Objectives

In this phase, we focus on building the **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Delivery (CD)** pipelines for the microservice application. This includes the following key components:

1. **Jenkins Infrastructure**: Automating the setup and configuration of Jenkins for CI.  
2. **Bastion Host**: Deploying a bastion host for secure access and to manage the delivery process using ArgoCD.

## Project Details

### Jenkins Infrastructure
- **Purpose**: To handle Continuous Integration tasks such as building and testing code changes.  
- **Scope**: This involves setting up Jenkins on a dedicated server with necessary configurations, plugins, and security measures to support the CI pipeline.

### Bastion Host with ArgoCD
- **Purpose**: To manage and secure the Continuous Delivery pipeline.  
- **Scope**: Deploying a bastion host that interfaces with ArgoCD to handle the deployment of microservices to the production EKS cluster.  

## Features Implemented So Far
- **Automated EKS Cluster**: Production-grade EKS setup from the first phase.
- **CI Setup**: Jenkins installation and preliminary configuration.

## Future Updates
This project is ongoing, and updates will be added periodically as new features and components are developed.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd devsecops_project_part2
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the setup documentation (to be updated).

## Next Steps
- Finalize Jenkins pipeline configurations.
- Automate bastion host deployment.
- Integrate ArgoCD for CD pipelines.

Stay tuned for updates!
